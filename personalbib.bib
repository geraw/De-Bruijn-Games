            In this work we generalize the fundamental notion of recognizability from

            of a right-morphism from the monoid of timed words into a bounded subset of
            itself. We show that the recognizable languages are exactly those accepted
            by deterministic timed automata and argue that this is the right class of
            timed languages, and that the closure of untimed regular languages under
            projection is a positive accident that cannot be expected to hold beyond the
            finite-state case.

  ABSTRACT  =     {  We examine linear single input single output finite dimensional systems. It is
                    shown that a continuous time controllable and observable system can be nullified utilizing
                    periodic sampling of the output with time varying linear feedback. Almost any sampling
                    rate can be used. The result relies on a characterization of linear output feedback nullification
                    of discrete time observable and controllable systems. An algorithm for the nullification
                    and an estimate on the time in which the algorithm is concluded are provided.

 and rewards as separate modelling features. A precise definition is then given of what constitutes optimal infinite behaviours for this class of models. We subsequently show that the derivation of optimal non-terminating schedules for such double-priced timed automata is computable. This is done by a reduction of the problem to the determination of optimal mean-cycles in finite graphs with weighted edges. This reduction is obtained by introducing the so-called corner-point abstraction, a powerful abstraction technique of which we show that it preserves optimal schedules.}

Under stronger conditions (strictness of constraints) we prove in addition that
 it is decidable whether there is an optimal strategy in which case an optimal strategy can be computed. Our results extend previous decidability result which requires the underlying game automata to be acyclic. Finally, our results are encoded in a first prototype in HyTech which is applied on a small case-study.}

 linear programs encountered during symbolic minimum-cost reachability analysis of priced timed automata can be exploited in order to substantially improve the performance of the current algorithm. The idea is rooted in duality of linear programs and we show that each encountered linear program can be reduced to the dual problem of an instance of the min-cost flow problem. Thus, we only need to solve instances of the much simpler min-cost flow problem during minimum-cost reachability analysis. Experimental results using Uppaal show a 70-80 percent performance gain. As a main application area, we show how to solve energy-optimal task graph scheduling problems using the framework of priced timed automata.}

Using the Cadence SMV symbolic model checker we synthesize, under certain error
assumptions, a scheduler for the smart card personalization system, a case
study that has been proposed by Cybernetix Recherche in the context of the
EU IST project AMETIST.  The controller that we synthesize, and of which we
prove optimality, has been previously patented.  Due to the large number of
states (which is beyond $10^{13}$), this synthesis problem appears to be out of
the scope of existing tools for controller synthesis, which typically use some
form of explicit state enumeration.  Our result provides new evidence that
model checkers can be useful to tackle industrial sized problems in the area of
scheduling and control synthesis.
